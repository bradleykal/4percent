                <p>Named for Mikaela Naylon (16, Colorado), who was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in 2020, relapsed four times, underwent a below-knee amputation, and spent her final weeks meeting with lawmakers in Washington and continuing by Zoom as her health declined.

                <p>Would mandate that NCI funding for childhood cancer research be <strong>proportional to the pediatric share of the U.S. population</strong> — increasing pediatric research funding from 4% to approximately 22% over time. This single bill would be the most transformative shift in pediatric cancer research funding in history.</p>
                <p>The act has strong bipartisan support and a growing list of co-sponsors, but faces resistance from budget committees and requires additional pressure to advance to a floor vote.</p>

                <p>Signed into law in 2017, the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act requires pharmaceutical companies to evaluate their molecularly targeted cancer drugs in pediatric populations when the drug's target is relevant to childhood cancers.</p>
                <p>A <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105947" target="_blank">2023 GAO progress report</a> found the law is beginning to yield results — but implementation and enforcement remain areas of active focus. Expansion of the RACE Act's scope is being discussed in the current Congress.</p>
