                    <p>Over the past two decades, 185 new cancer treatments were approved for adult patients. Only 3 were specifically developed for pediatric cancers. The RACE for Children Act is beginning to address this imbalance.</p>

                    <p>Approximately 17,000 children are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. every year. That's 46 families every single day facing devastating news — in a country that devotes only 4% of cancer research funding to finding cures.</p>

                    <h3>Long-Term Complications</h3>
                    <p>Nearly 60% of childhood cancer survivors face serious long-term health complications as adults — partly because pediatric-specific treatments remain underdeveloped due to the chronic funding shortfall.</p>

                <h3>This Must Change</h3>
                <p>The Fairness to Kids with Cancer Act would mandate that NCI funding for childhood cancer be proportional to the pediatric share of the U.S. population — bringing it from 4% toward 22% over time.</p>
